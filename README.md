# Video non-local Bayesian denoising

Release version of the code from the video denoising method publised in 

[P. Arias, J.-M. Morel, *Video Denoising via Empirical Bayesian Estimation of Space-Time Patches*</br>
Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, January 2018, Volume 60, Issue 1, pp 70â€“93.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-017-0742-4)

You can find most of the results reported in the article in the [projects web page](http://dev.ipol.im/~pariasm/video_nlbayes/).

The code is in C++. Compilation was tested in Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.
It requires having [CBLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/#_cblas) and 
[LAPACKE](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html) installed.
