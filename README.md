OVERVIEW
--------

This code provides an implementation of the video denoising method VNLB-H
described in:

[P. Arias, J.-M. Morel. "Video denoising via empirical Bayesian estimation of
space-time patches", Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, 60(1),
January 2018.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10851-017-0742-4)

Please cite the publication if you use results obtained with this code in your
research.

The following libraries are also included as part of the code:
* For computing the optical flow, it includes [the IPOL
implementation](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2013/26/) of
the [TV-L1 optical flow method of Zack and Pock and
Bischof](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74936-3_22).
* For image I/O, we use [Enric Meinhardt's iio](https://github.com/mnhrdt/iio).

**Dependencies:** The code depends on the following packages:
* [CBLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/#_cblas),
[LAPACKE](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html): operations with matrices
* OpenMP: parallelization [optional, but recommended]
* libpng, libtiff and libjpeg: image i/o


**Compilation:** 
Compilation was tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and 18.04.
Configure and compile the source code using cmake and make.
It is recommended that you create a folder for building:
```
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Binaries will be created in `build/bin folder`.

NOTE: By default, the code is compiled with OpenMP multithreaded
parallelization enabled (if your system supports it). Use the
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` enviroment variable to control the number of threads
used.

USAGE
-----

The compilation creates the following binaries:
* `awgn` add additive white Gaussian noise to an image sequence
* `psnr` compute PSNR (and RMSE) between two image sequences
* `tvl1flow` compute TVL1 optical flow between two frames
* `vnlbayes` run VNLB-H on an image sequence

In addition, the following helper scripts will be installed in `bin/`
* `tvl1flow-seq.sh` compute forward/backward optical flow for an image sequence
* `vnlb.sh` computes optical flow and run `vnlbayes`
* `vnlb-gt.sh` given a clean sequence: adds noise, computes optical flow, runs
denoising and computes PSNR

-----
**Usage of `vnlbayes`**

The simplest use is shown via the following example:

```
vnlbayes -i /my/video/frame-%03d.png -f 1 -l 10 -sigma 10
```

The method reads the video as a sequence of images. The sequence of images is passed
as a pattern in printf format, thus `frame-%03d.png` means that frames have the following 
filenames: `frame-001.png`, `frame-002.png`, etc. The first and last frame are
given with '-f' and '-l' (1 and 10 in the example). The denoising method performs
two steps or iterations. The outputs will be stored by default
in the folder from where the program is invoked: 
* `bsic_%03d.png`: first iteration (or basic estimate)
* `deno_%03d.png`: second (and final) iteration

If an optical flow (forward and backward) has been computed, it can be given to the 
method as
```
vnlbayes -i /my/video/frame-%03d.png -f 1 -l 10 -sigma 10\
         -fof /fwd/flow/frame-%03d.flo \
         -fof /bwd/flow/frame-%03d.flo
```

Several options can be given. For a list of all parameters run `vnlbayes
--help`.

*NOTE: The optical flow files given to the method should be numbered according to the
following convention:*
* *Forward flow at frame *i*: optical flow from frame *i* to *i+1
* *Backward flow at frame *i*: optical flow from frame *i* to *i-1

*For the first frame, there is no backward flow, and for the last frame there is
no forward flow. **However, the code of vnlbayes expects forward and backward
flow files for each frame, even for the first and the last frames** (this is due
to the author being lazy). The backward flow for the first frame and the forward
flow for the last frame will not be used, so they can be anything (an image full
of zeros, for example). The script `tvl1flow-seq.sh` computes the optical flows for
a sequence following the naming convention used by VNLB.*

-----
**Usage of `vnlb-gt.sh`**

```
vnlb-gt.sh /my/video/frame-%03d.png first-frame last-frame sigma out-folder ["vnlb-params"]
```

 `sigma` refers to the noise
standard deviation. Outputs are going to be left in `out-folder/`. The `vnlb-params` is an 
optional script to override any of the default parameters of the denoising. For a 
list of all parameters run `vnlbayes --help`.

Outputs include:
* `out-folder/%03d.tif`: frames with noise added (as tif floating point images)
* `out-folder/tvl1_%03d_f.flo` forward optical flows
* `out-folder/tvl1_%03d_b.flo` backward optical flows
* `out-folder/bsic_%03d.tif`: first iteration (or basic estimate)
* `out-folder/deno_%03d.tif`: second (and final) iteration
* `out-folder/measures-bsic`: global and per-frame RMSE/PSNR of first iteration
* `out-folder/measures-deno`: same for final iteration

-----
**Usage of `vnlb.sh`**

Same as `vnlb-gt.sh`. In this case the input video has noise. No noise is added
and PSNR/RMSE measures will not be computed.

-----
**Usage of `awgn`**

Adds additive white Gaussian noise to an image sequence
```
awgn sigma input-path output-path [first-frame last-frame]
```

Paths for input/output frames have to be given in printf format: e.g.
```
awgn 10 /input/frame-%02d.png /output/frame-%02.tiff 1 20
```
It can also be applied to a single image:
```
awgn 10 /input/image.png /output/image.tiff
```

-----
**Usage of `psnr`**

Computes PSNR and RMSE between two image sequences

```
psnr input1-path input2-path [first-frame last-frame [output-file]]
```

Paths for input/output frames have to be given in printf format.
Prints to standard output the global PSNR and RMSE and, if an output filename
is given, it appends to the file the global and per-frame PSNR and RMSE.

-----
**Usage of `tvl1flow-seq.sh`**

```tvl1flow-seq.sh /my/video/frame-%03d.png first-frame last-frame out-folder [dir]```

Computes the optical flow in direction `dir` (either `fwd`, `bwd` or `both`),
and stores the output files in `out-folder/tvl1_%03d_f.flo` and
`out-folder/tvl1_%03d_b.flo` (forward and backward flows respectively).
